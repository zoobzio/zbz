# Live Update #1 - Real File Watching!

üî• **This post was created by writing directly to the file system!**

## How it works:

1. **File written** to blog-content/live-update-1.md
2. **fsnotify detects** the file change
3. **Depot filesystem provider** triggers change event
4. **Flux collection watching** processes the update
5. **Docula regenerates** the blog automatically

## Time: 20:07:18

This demonstrates **true reactive file watching** - no manual triggers needed!
